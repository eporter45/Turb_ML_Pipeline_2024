Simulation outline for predicting pressure from velocity

Model Inputs
Inputs: Ux, Uy
Outputs: P

Simulation Inputs
- hyperparameters
- model inputs
- which trial from test cases to run
    inter, extrap or big. Start with inter
- model type (FCN vs KAN)
- data

Hyperparameters
- start at 1500 epochs for FCN, same for KAN
- apply weights to the xz and yz components to push them to zero
-

For FCN
- start w 10x10
- then shallow, wide (3/4deep, 32 wide)
- use scheduler at first
- dropout to 0.1 at first

For KAN
- start with [2, 5, 5]
- try and implement pruning
- see where auto encoding could be applied
- make sure you apply [-1,1] gating to the weighted "activation"
